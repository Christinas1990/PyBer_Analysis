# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to visualize the weekly fares for each city types as multi-line graph. 
To achieve the assignment, Omar has to use the knowledge of Python to clean the data frame and summarize it, 
then use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph. 

# Result 


The chart shows that the Urban area has the significantly higher volume of rides, drivers and total fares than Rural and Suburban area.

However, it show that average fare per ride and per driver for Urban area is lower than other city types.
It may mean Urban services users took shorter distant travels, or as there are many drivers it might set the fare lower than the othet city types. !

The summary graph shows total fares of three different city types (rural, suburban and urban). 
It clearly shows total fare in urban area is a lot more than the other city types. 
it also shows the great difference in suburban and rural area. 


#summary

Since, averge fare by per ride and driver is much more lower then the other city types, it might discourage dirvers to continue using the serives 
by PyBer. It also shows that the total rides in the Urban area is lower than the total drivers, which could mean many drivers are not active and 
wasting the serive provided by the company. It would be helpful to encourge them to give them more chance by promoting the service they provide. 
On the other hand, in the rural area, there are small number of drivers compare to the rides services they provide, which might effect the fare
to increase for the customers which could lead the decrease of service users. I would recommand them to promote it to increase the driver number.
